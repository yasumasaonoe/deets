Some carry bags and are possibly spectators.  In the forefront, a person pushing a baby stroller walks alongside the truck. Another person, seemingly wearing a Boston Red Sox jacket, is walking by.  Further down, there's another, smaller truck parked behind the main one, labeled \"Atlas Van Lines.\" This suggests a moving company is involved, reinforcing the relocation theme present in the advertisement.\u00a0\n\n\nThe street is wet, suggesting recent rain.
